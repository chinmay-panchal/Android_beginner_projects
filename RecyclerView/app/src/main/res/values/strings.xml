        Neuralink, founded by Elon Musk in 2017, is a startup with an ambitious goal: to create a brain-computer interface (BCI) that enables people to control devices using their thoughts. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Neuralink and its recent milestone:

The First Human Implant:

Neuralink has successfully implanted its first brain chip in a human. The implant, known as the ‚ÄúLink,‚Äù is a small device comparable in size to five stacked coins. It is surgically placed inside the human brain1.
The surgery was carried out after receiving clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the first trial of the implant on humans2.
Initial results indicate promising neuron spike detection. Neurons are cells that use electrical and chemical signals to transmit information within the brain and to the body2.
Telepathy and Control:

Elon Musk revealed that the first Neuralink product is called ‚ÄúTelepathy.‚Äù This technology allows users to control their phones, computers, and other devices simply by thinking2.
The initial users targeted are those who have lost the use of their limbs. Imagine if someone like Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer using this technology2.
Significance and Challenges:

While Musk has a history of bold promises, this achievement represents a significant milestone toward the goal of creating a functional brain-computer interface.
Neuralink joins a relatively small group of companies that have successfully implanted devices in humans for brain-computer interfaces.
True success will be evaluated over time, considering the stability of the interface and its benefits to participants2.
In summary, Neuralink‚Äôs progress is both exciting and challenging, and it brings us closer to a future where our minds can directly interact with technology. üß†üíª

        The facts:

As of December 2023, India was the top source of tourists for the Maldives, accounting for nearly 11% of total arrivals.
However, data from the Maldives\' tourism ministry shows a significant drop in Indian tourists in recent weeks.
As of January 28, 2024, India has slipped to the 5th position, with Russia, Italy, China, and the UK now occupying the top four spots.
Possible reasons for the decline:

Diplomatic tensions: Some experts suggest that a recent diplomatic spat between India and the Maldives might be influencing travel decisions. This includes Prime Minister Modi\'s visit to Lakshadweep, which some Maldivians perceived as a challenge to their tourism industry.
Alternative destinations: India itself is developing its own beach tourism destinations like Lakshadweep, which could be attracting some travelers who might have otherwise chosen the Maldives.
It\'s important to note that:

This is a recent development, and the long-term impact on tourism remains to be seen.
The reasons for the decline are complex and likely involve a combination of factors.

    Experienced opener David Warner on Friday became the first player from Australia to make 100 appearances in all formats of cricket following his inclusion in Australia\'s playing XI for the first T20I clash against West Indies on Friday. Warner making his 100th appearance in the T20I, joined the likes of former skipper Aaron Finch (103) and star all-rounder Glenn Maxwell (100) to become just the third Australian player to achieve the feat. Overall Warner joins the elite company of India\\\'s stalwart batter Virat Kohli and New Zealand\'s Ross Taylor to become the third man to represent his country a hundred times in all formats.

Coming to the match, West Indies skipper Rovman Powell won the toss and elected to bowl first in the first T20I of the three-match series against Australia at Bellerive Oval.

Warner is leading the Baggy Greens, as the captain Mitchell Marsh has suffered Covid, however, he will play the fixture.

At the time of the toss, Warner said, "We were going to bowl first as well. The wicket looks nice. Generally in the first six, you can give yourself some time. There are some variables with the wind, and one side a bit big. Mitch has taken his mask off today. He's come back alright. If the game was yesterday he wouldn't have been able to play. No Spencer Johnson or Aaron Hardie but it's still six changes from the last T20I Australia played."

Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Josh Inglis, Mitchell Marsh(c), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Tim David, Matthew Wade(w), Sean Abbott, Adam Zampa, Jason Behrendorff, Josh Hazlewood

West Indies (Playing XI): Brandon King, Johnson Charles, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Shai Hope, Rovman Powell (c), Sherfane Rutherford, Andre Russell, Romario Shepherd, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Jason Holder.

Instagram\'s Close Friends feature that lets you limit your posts, Reels, Stories, and Notes to just close friends was expanded to more users in November last year. Now, the Meta-owned photo and video-sharing platform is bringing a new feature called "Flipside" to make the app feel more private. Instagram Head Adam Mosseri says the feature is currently in testing. The feature would allow users to create a secondary photo grid that only designated friends will be able to see. It will show as an alternative account to your existing profile and will allow you to post more personal pictures and videos with a select group of followers and friends.

In a Thread post on Monday (January 29), Instagram Head Adam Mosseri confirmed that the company is testing a feature called Flipside. ‚ÄúWe\'re not even sure we\'ll launch it on Instagram,‚Äù Mosseri wrote in response to a user on Threads post. "On one hand it feels good to create a clear space that feels more private. On the other, it\'s yet another way to reach a smaller audience on top of secondary accounts and Close Friends. We\'ll see how people respond in the test, and iterate forward", he added.

Meanwhile, noted social media consultant on Threads posted a video showing off the Flipside tool that would allow users to create a private side to their Instagram pages where they could post more personal pictures and videos for a subset of their friends. The feature is said to be rolling out to select people for testing according to him. He states that the concept behind Flipside ‚Äúessentially productise "finstas'‚Äù ‚Äî a popular slang term for alternate personal Instagram accounts where people post their real-life photos ‚Äî for the Instagram audience.

        KEY FACTS
In a two-hour interview released Thursday night, Putin defended Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, arguing Russia has a historic claim to areas of western Ukraine dating back to the 13th century, a claim Putin has made repeatedly in the two years since Russia launched its invasion.

In the interview, which was recorded at the Kremlin on Tuesday, Putin claimed parts of Ukraine along the Black Sea ‚Äúhave no historical connection to Ukraine whatsoever,‚Äù according to a translation posted on Carlson‚Äôs website.

Carlson attempted to push back against Putin‚Äôs nearly 40-minute monologue on Russian history‚Äîincluding Russia‚Äôs position in World War II and the creation of the Soviet Union‚Äîasking what the history has to do with ‚Äúwhat happened two years ago.‚Äù

Putin also cited the eastern expansion of NATO as a reason for a ‚Äúrift‚Äù between western countries and Russia, arguing ‚Äúthe promise was that NATO would not expand eastward but it happened five times,‚Äù saying that Russia tried to push against the expansion leading up to its conflict with Ukraine.

Carlson broke into a laugh on two occasions when Putin asked if the interview was a ‚Äútalk show or a serious conversation.‚Äù

Putin also argued Ukraine, and not Russia, started the war in 2014 when Russia illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula by ‚Äúpreparing for military action,‚Äù and adding: ‚Äúour goal is to stop this war‚Äù (Putin had previously referred to the war as a ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù and denied responsibility for starting the war, a narrative western leaders have rejected).

When asked if Russia has ‚Äúachieved [its] aims‚Äù in Ukraine, Putin said it has not, naming one of Russia‚Äôs goals is to prohibit ‚Äúall kinds of neo-Nazi movements‚Äù in Ukraine in a process he called the ‚Äúde-Nazification‚Äù of Ukraine, a claim debunked as ‚Äúfactually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive,‚Äù according to a group of scholars from more than a dozen western countries.

When asked about U.S. involvement in the war, Putin argued, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have anything better to do?‚Äù while citing American domestic ‚Äúissues on the border, issues with migration, issues with the national debt.‚Äù

Carlson also asked Putin if he has evidence the CIA was involved in the explosion of the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea, a theory Putin has repeated and Carlson has speculated‚ÄîPutin did not provide evidence, but said Russia ‚Äúshould look for someone who‚Äôs interested‚Äù and ‚Äúsomeone who has capabilities.‚Äù

Carlson also asked Putin if he would be willing to release Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was detained last year on espionage charges the Journal has condemned and the U.S. says are unfounded.

Putin said he believes an agreement can be reached, but reiterated Russia‚Äôs claim that Gershkovich gained confidential information and is ‚Äúessentially controlled by the U.S. authorities.‚Äù
